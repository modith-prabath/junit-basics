There is an anntation provdided by juit called test instance 
This states the behaviour of when a class instance is created.
By default even without annotation it works as LifeCycle.PER_METHOD (Enum)
So, there two types PER_METHOD AND PER_CLASS 
PER_METHOD create new class instance for each method run 
PER_CLASS creates only one instance of class for all methods . Usually this is a bad practice , s use it only if required
